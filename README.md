# üì¶ Stock Management System

> üìò **Note:** This system is developed as part of our **Final Year Project** and also contributes to our **Final Exam assessment**. All code, documentation, and design submissions are managed through GitHub for review, correction, and collaboration.

## üîç Introduction

The **Stock Management System** is a full-stack web application created by our group as part of our college coursework. The main objective of this project is to build a system that allows businesses to manage their inventory and stock in a simple, fast, and organized way. The system keeps track of available products, orders, stock levels, customer interactions, and other important data needed for smooth day-to-day operations.

This solution is designed specifically for **small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs)** that want to move away from manually updating spreadsheets or writing things down on paper. By moving their stock management process to a digital platform, businesses can reduce human error, save time, and make better decisions based on real-time information.

## üéØ Project Goal and Objectives

The purpose of this project is not only to develop a working web application but also to apply the technical skills we‚Äôve learned so far in a real-world-like situation. This includes working as a team, following a clean coding structure, using GitHub for version control, and applying development tools such as Visual Studio and SQL Server.

### Specific Goals:
- ‚úÖ Build a responsive stock management system.
- ‚úÖ Allow different user roles (Admin and permitted Staff) to log in and perform actions.
- ‚úÖ Add/edit/delete products and track their stock levels in real-time.
- ‚úÖ Manage and track customer orders and supplier purchases.
- ‚úÖ Generate real-time reports and data exports.
- ‚úÖ Implement basic system security, including password hashing and input validation.
